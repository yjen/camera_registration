lol need to rewrite all of this...

move chessboard2.launch to davinci_vision?

files we actually run now: robo_registration.py, registration_new.sh, inverse_camera_broadcaster.py, robot_broadcaster_left.py, robot_broadcaster_right.py, (should probably move stuff from raven_2_vision here)



TLDR: to register cameras to robot frame, run registration_new.sh

wrote chessboard2.launch in raven_2_vision

should probably put the rospy.is_shutdown in all files

registration_new.sh launches the cameras' chessboard recognition modules, publishes frame to /BC/chessboard, robo_registration

robo_registration.py allows user to teleop the dvrk and record poses, which it uses to find pose of chessboard in robot frame (need to do for each arm separately); save pose data in pose_data_left/right.p and combines robot frame chessboard pose with /BC/chessboard to find transform from camera to robot; saves in transform_left/right.txt

camera_to_robot_broadcaster broadcasts transforms in transform_left/right.txt

note that I commented out the ROSINFO lines in chessboard_tracker
also after registration is finished, use ps -e; kill ___ (find chessboard_trac) to get rid of the chessboard tracker windows. finally, run camera_to_robot_broadcaster
